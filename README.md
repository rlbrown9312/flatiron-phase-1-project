# flatiron-phase-1-project
### Hello there 

My name is Richard Brown and I am a software engineer student in phase-1 of my learning curriculum. 

Below is a description of my first project. I've decided to make an single page application incorporating my newly learned skills of javascript, html, css, and json. 
I have created a Scooby-Doo fan page and store. My content comes from a db.json file that I have created. When the page loads the client sees an image of each of the five beloved members of Mystery Incorporated. When hovering over the images each specific image being hovered over at the time increases in size and comes closer to the screen. Such an inviting display suggests that each image can be clicked, and when clicked upon, each image displays the member's name and provides description of each one's character.

Below the characters is a store holding a collection of Scooby-Doo inspired items. Similar to above, each item in the store when hovered over becomes interactive and increases in size. Each item when clicked shows the selected items price and inventory amount. If the object is desired, the user can add the item to their bag for a hopefully future purchase.
