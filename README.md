#flatiron-phase-1-project

Hello there! 

My name is Richard Brown and I'm a software engineer student in phase 1 of my learning curriculum. 

Below is a description of my first project. 

I've made a single page application incorporating my newly learned skills of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have created a Scooby-Doo fan page and store, and my content comes from a db.json. When the page loads, with the help of DomContentLoaded, the user sees a container of images, each image being of the five beloved members of Mystery Incorporated. Each image when hovered over increases in size and invitingly comes closer to the screen. Such a display is suggesting that each image can be clicked upon. And when clicked, each image displays the member's name, a description, and an individualized catchphrase that each character is known for. 

Below the characters is a store holding a collection of Scooby-Doo inspired items. Similarly to above, each item in the store when hovered over becomes interactive and increases in size. Each item when clicked shows the selected item's price and inventory amount. If the object is desired by the user, the user can click on the submit button labeled, "Add to Bag." The logistics of actually buying the products has not been fully explored, but maybe one day that cart of items won't only be available in your browser, but eventually in your home as well. 

Below is a link to my first blog discussing the thought process to my project and also of my time thus far as a new coder.
