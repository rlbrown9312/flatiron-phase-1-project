# flatiron-phase-1-project
### Hello there 

My name is Richard Brown and I am a software engineer student in phase-1 of my learning curriculum. 

Below is a description of my first project. 

I've made a single page application incorporating my newly learned skills of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I have created a Scooby-Doo fan page and store, and my content comes from a db.json file. When the page loads the user sees an image of each of the five beloved members of Mystery Incorporated. When hovered over each image being hovered over increases in size and comes closer to the screen. Such an inviting display is suggesting that each image can be clicked upon. And when clicked, each image displays the member's name, a description, and an individualized catchphrase of each of the characters. 

Below the characters is a store holding a collection of Scooby-Doo inspired items. Similarly to above, each item in the store when hovered over becomes interactive and increases in size. Each item when clicked shows the selected item's price and inventory amount. If the object is desired by the user, the user can submit the item, adding the item to their bag. The logistics of actually buying the products has not been fully explored, but maybe one day that cart of items won't only be available in the browser, but in your home as well.
