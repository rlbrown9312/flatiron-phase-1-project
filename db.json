Scooby's prevalent character traits, in addition to being loyal and adorable, are cowardice and being perpetually hungry. And because Scooby is typically hungry and scared, he often requires bribary with food, namely with 'Scooby Snacks', as incentive to continue searching for clues to solve the mystery.",

Shaggy becomes extremely scared when faced with monsters or other frightening situations. Usually he displays cowardice to a much greater degree than any other character, except for Scooby. He is also noted to run very fast, even speeding past Scooby on occasion to escape the masked villain. However, despite his cowardice, he remains a loyal member of Mystery Inc.",

She follows her intuition, but unfortunately commonly serves as the damsel in distress and occasionally gets kidnapped, tied up, and even left imprisoned. But, as time went on, she became a stronger, more independent character who could take care of herself. She even in later renditions of the Scooby series learned how to fight, earning a black belt in karate. She is also quite good at using her make up accessories to pick open locks on locked doors and cages. She proves to be quite resourceful indeed.",
